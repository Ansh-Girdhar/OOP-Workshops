Part 1 of the workshop was not complicated as it didn’t contain new concepts to work with.
Part 2 of the workshop was hard for me as I spent so much time doing that. I learned a new function called chrono which was extremely helpful for this workshop as it helped me complete my Timer.h file. Other than that, I used copy constructor, destructor and move constructor.
There were so many memory leaks in part2 which took so much time to solve. In this workshop for the first time.
